                  <p class="mb-0">First year in college wasn't very easy. New places, new people, different vibes nothing was ever similar. Till I saw her, well honestly she seemed very familiar.
                    She was incredibly beautiful and cute. So what directly came up to my mind is that she was one of those girls which you know that a decent amount of guys have tried to get close to her. 
                    That really blocked me from even trying, I mean let's be honest, the coolest guys have tried and she didn't respond, 
                    what chances do I have to compete with them. That kept me away from even trying to be a friend with her, honestly I've even started to get close to other girls.

                  <p class="mb-0">Well things actually changed. A year after a year in college we started to have mutual friends, they opened the door for us to talk, it wasn't that much at the beggining,
                    but projects, and assignments opened many topics to talk more and to know each others even better. We were just friends, I actually started to like the way of her thinking, how she solves problems,
                    how smart and funny she is. She's not that northen star that you'll never get a chance to get any closer to.<br> Thing became better over time, she trusted me and did too. We both became really
                    good friends, nothing more, I even was with someone else and so did she. But I always found her in the center of my comfort zone.

                  <p class="mb-0">Problems between some of the mutual friends caused us to stop contacting, calls stopped, messages were not responded or even seen. After a while I assumed that she's going
                    to get engaged and maybe he's forcing her to cut off all her friends. It wasn't easy for me, I mean I've lost one of my best friends and the one that I trust to speak about a lot of sensitive things. 
                    Yes I was rally upset of her and decided just to move on and never look back again. <br>
                    8 months later, I got a good job offer aboard. I just left, I didn't tell her or even say goodbye eventhoug I've seen her once in one of our freinds birthday but my decision was made, I am leaving.

                    Too many questions popped up suddendly, honestly I even said don't pick it up and ignore her as well as she did. But I couldn't, I thought that I've forgot everything about her,
                    but it turned out that the memories were deeply stored in my heart, they pushed me to pick it up and hear her voice for the first time since too long.<br>
                    She just came out from a toxic relationship that destroyed her spark. She needed me, and I couldn't do anything but to support her. We started to talk again, she calrified why she ghosted me at the beginning and 
                    she seemed very sorry, I really wanted to feel that, because I needed her as much as she did.</p>

                    We decided to meet at the place where everything started, in front of the college. We went to eat Sushi, her favorite desh, and the one that I've never tried before. We then had a long

                    She raises me up in the sky whenever she laughs and turns my life into darkness whenever I feel that she's not okay. I didn't want to surrender to this feeling. I kept 
                    convencing myself that we are just friends, and nothing more will happen. Till this day, we supposed to meet up but something urgent popped up so I had to cancel, the thing that made her 
                    upset with me for the first time ever. I couldn't handle it, I took my car and exceeded every speed limit could ever be just to get to her and appologise. I was shocked from my reaction. 
                    Why am I doing that? I walked her back, and on the way I wasn't really conscious thinking of what am I doing, till finally it spelt out of my toungh "Rawan, I love You".

                    The next day, it was the day before Eid. She had a night shift. Me and the boys went out, I then suggested to go somewhere which was close to her work place. Once we got there, 
                    I didn't give it a second thought, I miss her so much I really want to see her now no matter what even for 10 minutes. I drove to her work place, called her, and asked to see her.
                    She laughed, and actually she liked that I came to see her, it turned out that she herself wanted to see me. That was one of the best moments ever when we walked together, didn't talk 
                    about what I've said yesterday. But instead, my hand slipped and touched her hand, she didn't refuse it at the beginning and for the first time, I held her hand. It didn't take so much as we then 
                    realized what are we doing, so we moved our hands, but then I totally realized. I'm in deep love with this girl.

                    to see her like a little girl, enjoying herself with all those games, jumping from to the other, laughing deeply from her heart and doesn't care about whoever watches or whatever. It was

                    She looked so angelic in that slim white dress. I was told to pretend to be shocked in the first look, but I didn't 
                    pretend. I was really surprised and charmed with all of this cuteness, softness and warmness. I finally put my ring 
                    in her fingers, kissed her hand in front of everyone. And finally, she's oficially mine.
